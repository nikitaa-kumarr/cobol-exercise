COBOL to Python Migration Methodology
=====================================

How I Understood the COBOL
--------------------------

I started by asking Claude to provide a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the entire `legacy_app.cob` file. The prompt was:

"Explain this code in legacy_app.cob line by line. Don't miss on any information. Mention edge cases or limits. Explain clearly so someone can implement the same behavior in another language."

This produced a comprehensive analysis that gave me complete visibility into how the legacy system operates, what its constraints are, and which quirks must be preserved.

How I Defined "Correct Migration"
---------------------------------

After understanding the COBOL system, I created a behavioral specification document with this prompt:

"Using the above analysis and read full code given in legacy_app.cob, create behavioral_spec.md in Markdown format. Include all operations, what the system is doing, edge cases, Expected behaviour that must be present in any migration"

I then instructed Claude to convert the code with this prompt:

"Convert the cobol code in legacy_app.cob into modern Python code using behavioral_spec.md. Preserve all functionality and constraints in legacy_app.cob. Do not add any extra features or enhancements. Handle all edge cases. Maintain cobol quirks and bugs for faithful migration."

"Correct Migration" Means
-------------------------

-   Exact replication of all COBOL behaviors without improvements

-   Preserving bugs and quirks

-   Maintaining all limits

-   Matching all output messages, prompts, and error text exactly

-   No security enhancements or optimizations

This strict definition ensures the Python version is functionally identical to the COBOL original.

Testing Strategy
----------------

I developed a comprehensive testing approach in two phases:

Phase 1: Test Suite Creation
----------------------------

I prompted Claude:

"Generate a python test suite named behavioral_tests.py to validate the Python migration modern_app.py of the legacy cobol program. Use behavioral_spec.md as the guide for expected behavior. Test all the functionality and edge cases described in spec."

The Test Requirements Included
------------------------------

-   Register user successfully

-   Reject duplicate username

-   Reject when DB full (100 users)

-   Login with valid credentials

-   Reject invalid credentials

-   Generate valid session token

-   Token maps to correct user

-   Change password with valid token + old password

-   Reject invalid token

-   Reject wrong old password

-   Handle multiple sessions

-   Reject when session table full (50 sessions)

This created 43 automated tests organized into 9 feature categories covering all COBOL behaviors.

Phase 2: Evaluation Framework
-----------------------------

I then prompted Claude:

"Generate two Python scripts for evaluating the Python migration (modern_app.py) using behavioral_tests.py:

-   evaluate_refactor.py - Implements a grading/evaluation system

-   run_evaluation.py - Imports and executes evaluate_refactor.py"

These scripts automate the verification process, running all tests and producing detailed reports.

Grading System
--------------

Grading Philosophy
------------------

**Purpose:** Quantify migration fidelity

**Metric:** Test pass rate (0-100%)

Grading Components
------------------

Component 1: Test Execution (`evaluate_refactor.py`)
----------------------------------------------------

**Process:**

1.  Import `behavioral_tests.py`

2.  Load all test classes

3.  Execute tests with `unittest.TextTestRunner`

4.  Collect results (passed, failed, errors)

**Calculation:**

python

`total_tests = result.testsRun
passed = total_tests - len(result.failures) - len(result.errors)
score = (passed / total_tests * 100) if total_tests > 0 else 0`

Component 2: Feature Breakdown
------------------------------

**Categorization:**

-   User Registration: 8 tests

-   User Login: 8 tests

-   Password Change: 8 tests

-   String Padding: 3 tests

-   Menu System: 5 tests

-   Token Generation: 3 tests

-   Data Structures: 3 tests

-   Integration Tests: 3 tests

-   Error Messages: 2 tests

**Per-Category Score:**

python

`category_passed = estimated_total - len(category_failures)
category_score = (category_passed / estimated_total) * 100`

Component 3: Critical Behaviors Checklist
-----------------------------------------

**10 Critical COBOL Behaviors:**

1.  ✓ 20-character space-padded strings

2.  ✓ 100 user limit enforcement

3.  ✓ 50 session limit enforcement

4.  ✓ Token range 100000-999999

5.  ✓ Password change bug (line 210)

6.  ✓ Case-sensitive username comparison

7.  ✓ Plaintext password storage

8.  ✓ No session expiration

9.  ✓ Sequential search (no optimization)

10. ✓ Exact error message text

**Scoring:** Each critical behavior worth 10% of critical subscore

Component 4: Letter Grade Assignment
------------------------------------

**Grading Scale:**

-   100%: A+ (Excellent)

-   90-99%: A (Very Good)

-   80-89%: B (Good)

-   70-79%: C (Satisfactory)

-   60-69%: D (Needs Improvement)

-   Below 60%: F (Unsatisfactory)

Report Generation
-----------------

1\. Overall Score
-----------------

-   Percentage score

-   Letter grade

-   Tests passed/failed/errors

2\. Feature Compliance Breakdown
--------------------------------

-   Per-category status (PASS/FAIL)

-   Tests passed in category

-   First failure location

4\. Critical Behaviors Verification

Exit Code System
----------------

**Exit Codes:**

-   `0`: All tests passed (100% score) - SUCCESS

-   `1`: Some tests failed (< 100%) - PARTIAL SUCCESS

-   `2`: Fatal error during evaluation - FAILURE





What the Grading System Measures
--------------------------------

Measures
--------

**Functional Correctness**

-   Do operations produce correct results?

-   Are error conditions handled properly?

**Behavioral Fidelity**

-   Does it match COBOL behavior exactly?

-   Are edge cases handled identically?

**Bug Preservation**

-   Are known bugs replicated?

-   Do bugs behave identically?

**Data Structure Compliance**

-   Are capacities enforced correctly?

-   Are strings padded properly?

-   Are types correct?

**Message Accuracy**

-   Do error messages match exactly?

-   Plaintext passwords expected

-   Predictable tokens expected

**Performance**
