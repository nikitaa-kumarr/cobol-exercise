COBOL to Python Migration Project Report
========================================

COBOL Knowledge Before Starting
-------------------------------

**None**

Setup
-----

-   **Version:** 2.0.10 (Claude Code)

-   **Time spent:** 6 hours

-   **Approach:** Supervised - I guided Claude through each step with specific prompts and manually verified outputs

What I Did
----------

Step 1: Understanding the Legacy COBOL Code
-------------------------------------------

I uploaded `legacy_app.cob` and asked Claude to explain it comprehensively:



`# Command/Prompt used
"Explain this code in legacy_app.cob line by line. Don't miss on any information. Mention edge cases or limits. Explain clearly so someone can implement the same behavior in another language."`

**Result:** Claude produced a detailed 220-line analysis covering all COBOL divisions, data structures, control flow, edge cases, and bugs. This gave me complete understanding without knowing COBOL syntax.

Step 2: Creating Behavioral Documentation
-----------------------------------------

After understanding the code, I asked Claude to formalize everything into a specification:



`# Command/Prompt used
"Using the above analysis and read full code given in legacy_app.cob, create behavioral_spec.md in Markdown format. Include all operations, what the system is doing, edge cases, Expected behaviour that must be present in any migration."`

**Result:** Generated `behavioral_spec.md` - a comprehensive reference document capturing every system behavior, constraint, and edge case.

Step 3: Converting COBOL to Python
----------------------------------

With the spec as reference, I instructed Claude to perform the migration:



`# Command/Prompt used
"Convert the cobol code in legacy_app.cob into modern Python code using behavioral_spec.md. Preserve all functionality and constraints in legacy_app.cob. Do not add any extra features or enhancements. Handle all edge cases. Maintain cobol quirks and bugs for faithful migration."`

**Result:** Claude generated `modern_app.py` with faithful COBOL-to-Python conversion preserving all original behaviors.

Step 4: Building Test Suite
---------------------------

I asked Claude to create comprehensive tests based on the behavioral specification:



`# Command/Prompt used
"Generate a python test suite named behavioral_tests.py to validate the Python migration modern_app.py of the legacy cobol program. Use behavioral_spec.md as the guide for expected behavior. Test all the functionality and edge cases described in spec.   Tests should include: - Register user successfully - Reject duplicate username - Reject when DB full (100 users) - Login with valid credentials - Reject invalid credentials - Generate valid session token - Token maps to correct user - Change password with valid token + old password - Reject invalid token - Reject wrong old password - Handle multiple sessions - Reject when session table full (50 sessions)"`

**Result:** Generated 43 automated tests organized into 9 feature categories covering all COBOL behaviors.

Step 5: Creating Evaluation and Grading System
----------------------------------------------

I prompted Claude to build automated evaluation infrastructure:



`# Command/Prompt used
"Generate two Python scripts for evaluating the Python migration (modern_app.py) using behavioral_tests.py:   1\. evaluate_refactor.py
 - Implements a grading/evaluation system - Runs the behavioral_tests.py test suite programmatically - Calculates: Total tests run, passed, failed, percentage score - Highlights which features are working correctly - Clearly flags failed tests and associated COBOL behaviors - Outputs a human-readable report - Returns exit code 0 if all tests pass, else non-zero   2\. run_evaluation.py
 - Imports and executes evaluate_refactor.py - Runs all tests automatically - Prints the grading report and summary score   Do not modify the test suite or system under test. Preserve all COBOL quirks and bugs. Use only Python standard libraries."`

**Result:** Created two evaluation scripts that automatically grade migration fidelity with detailed reporting.

Step 6: Documenting the Project
-------------------------------

Finally, I asked Claude to create comprehensive documentation:



`# Command/Prompt used
"Generate a README.md for my COBOL → Python migration project. Include project description, prerequisites, how to run tests using run_evaluation.py, and what the expected output looks like."`

**Result:** Generated complete project README with usage instructions, examples, and test categories.

What Worked
-----------

-   Line-by-line COBOL analysis was extremely thorough and accessible for someone with zero COBOL knowledge

-   Behavioral specification document served as excellent bridge between COBOL and Python implementations

-   Preservation of quirks and bugs when explicitly instructed - Claude successfully maintained legacy behavior

-   Comprehensive test generation that caught edge cases and validated all COBOL-specific behaviors

-   Automated evaluation framework provided clear, actionable feedback on migration fidelity

What Didn't Work
----------------

-   Had to manually verify Claude didn't add unnecessary features

-   Required verification that exact COBOL error messages were preserved

-   Had to be very specific about "faithful migration" vs "modernization" to prevent Claude from optimizing code
